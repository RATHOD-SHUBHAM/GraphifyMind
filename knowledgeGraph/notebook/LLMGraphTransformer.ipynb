        "allowed_nodes (List[str], optional) – Specifies which node types are allowed in the graph. Defaults to an empty list, allowing all node types.\n",

        "\n",
        "node_properties (Union[bool, List[str]]) – If True, the LLM can extract any node properties from text. Alternatively, a list of valid properties can be provided for the LLM to extract, restricting extraction to those specified.\n",

        "ignore_tool_usage (bool) – Indicates whether the transformer should bypass the use of structured output functionality of the language model. If set to True, the transformer will not use the language model’s native function calling capabilities to handle structured output. Defaults to False.\n",
